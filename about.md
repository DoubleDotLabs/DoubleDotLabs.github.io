# Double Dot Labs

Double Dot Labs is a group of developers and designers building things for the open source community. By providing resources for developers and encouraging collaboration, we hope to bring new people into open source and help to connect them with meaningful projects and ideas.

Okay, that's a fairly vague description of what we do. Double Dot Labs is not meant to be specific - rather, it represents a general ownership of a variety of community-managed projects in order to battle an increasingly difficult problem in open source software: Attribution. Our branding is intentionally vague because it doesn't actually exist. Our projects are not built by Double Dot Labs, they are built by the people that made them, and this undefined entity exists in order to represent that. Just as our projects are accessible to the community, no one person has total ownership over them, and as such everyone is credited equally for their work.
