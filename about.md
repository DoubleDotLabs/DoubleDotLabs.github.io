Double Dot Labs is a group of developers and designers building things for the open source community.
By providing resources for developers and encouraging collaboration, we hope to bring new people into
open source and help to connect them with meaningful projects and ideas.

Okay, that's a fairly vague description of what we do. We are hoping to expand upon this later, but
to be honest we're not really quite ready to do that yet. At the moment, we are working with the
amazing people at [Unicorn Utterances](https://unicorn-utterances.com/) to create a collection of
educational material for everyone. We have various projects of our own - such as the
["doki"](https://github.com/doubledotlabs/doki) Android library and ["DungeonGL"](https://github.com/doubledotlabs/DungeonGL),
which we will continue to support and maintain. As ludicrous as it sounds for a bunch of nerds building
free software, we hope to grow this into a profitable business which can support our goals and help us
continue to write good code.

## Licensing

For most of our endeavors, we largely rely on
either the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)
in order to attribute objectively educational material directly to the public domain. However,
outside of educational material - in cases where the origin of a particular material may matter to
its eventual end users (e.g. in a dependency which may be implemented by other works) - a slightly
less permissive option such as the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) may be
used to ensure that derivatives of the work remain open and trustworthy; copyright will be attributed
to "[project] contributors" in these cases. In situations specifically related to Double Dot Labs
(the source code of this site, for example), ownership may be slightly more restricted with the
copyright attributed to "Double Dot Labs members." It is important to note that while Double Dot
Labs is not an actual legal entity, its members are, and this statement remains valid as a result.

## Membership

Currently, membership is restricted to people who have significant and active involvement in our
projects. If you consider yourself an active contributor to our work and would like to be included
as a member, send an email to [mail@doubledot.dev](mailto:mail@doubledot.dev) with the subject line
'Member Request' and we will respond accordingly.

Membership does not in any way imply an endorsement of a particular individual by Double Dot Labs,
nor does it grant any higher privileges or priority over other people in the community.

## Communication

Double Dot Labs has an off-topic channel on [freenode.net](https://freenode.net/) that is used for
general discussion. To join, you can follow [this link](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23doubledotlabs&uio=MTY9dHJ1ZSY5PXRydWUmMTE9MjE1e1)
to access the web client, or follow the steps below to join it using another client:

1. Set the server address to `chat.freenode.net`.
2. Does your client have support for SSL/TLS? If so, set the port to `6697`, otherwise use port `6667`.
3. Use the command `/nick <nickname>` to change your nickname.
4. Join the `##doubledotlabs` channel by running the command `/join ##doubledotlabs`.

If you plan to use the same nickname the next time you visit, it is recommended to register it with
freenode so that you can verify your identity in the future and prevent the nickname from being taken
by somebody else. You can do this by following the steps in [freenode's documentation](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration).

For a more detailed version of the above steps, see our published article on
[Joining Freenode IRC: A Guide](https://doubledot.dev/blog/2019-03-06-Freenode-IRC-Setup/).
